This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

I originally wrote this site using Django, however, rebuilt it and continued to develop using React and Next.js in order to improve my JavaScript skills. You can view the Django version at https://github.com/mnalley95/website_django.
