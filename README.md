This is an updated build of my personal website. It was originally built in Django(https://github.com/mnalley95/website_django), but has since been rebuilt using React and Next.js to improve my JavaScript.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
